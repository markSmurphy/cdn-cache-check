# Changelog

## [1.0.x] - (unreleased)

### Changed

* Updated `--help` text to match `README.md` documentation.

### Fixed

* Refactored `configuration.js` so that `getDefaults()` is called just once, rather than once per exported function. Not only is this now more efficient, but it cuts down on the `--debug` output making it more readable.
