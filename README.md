HTTP caching is an important component in the delivery of a fast web site. This command line utility helps to analyse URLs to determine if they're served via a CDN and the caching behaviours of both the CDN and the user-agent.

## Quick Start

Install globally using:

```text
npm -g install cdn-cache-check
```

Check a single URL using `ccc [URL]`:

```text
ccc https://www.rolex.com/
```

![cdn-cache-check - Single URL](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ccc.single.url.gif)

---
Check multiple URLs using `ccc [URL [URL […]]]`:

```text
ccc https://www.rolls-royce.com/ https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/
```

![cdn-cache-check - Multiple URLs](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ccc.multiple.urls.gif)

---
Check a list of URLs read from a text file using `ccc [filename]`:

```text
ccc URLs.examples.txt
```

![cdn-cache-check - Single text file](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ccc.single.file.gif)

Where `URLs.examples.txt` contains:

```text
#List of example URLs
www.twitch.tv
www.reddit.com
www.stackoverflow.com
www.adobe.com
https://www.wired.com/
https://www.rolex.com/
```

## Overview

If you're looking into web site performance you'll be interested, at some stage of your analysis, in caching, compression and CDNs. `cdn-cache-check` aims to help with this task by making HTTP requests and reporting on the response headers that control these aspects across multiple URLs at a time.

---

## Usage

Supply `cdn-cache-check` with a URL, or the name of a text file containing URLs, and it will issue HTTP requests for each. You can supply multiple URLs or multiple filenames (separated by a `space`), and you can mix-and-match them too if you wish.

It will also attempt to detect the CDN serving each unique domain by performing a recursive DNS resolution and check if the domain resolves to a known CDN's apex domain.

```text
ccc [URL|file [URL|file […]]] [options]
```

## Options

### URL

The `URL` can be any valid URL or a bare domain, in which case `HTTPS` will be used when making the request.

```text
ccc https://example.com
```

```text
ccc example.com
```

### filename

The file should be a plain text file with a URL on each line. Lines which do not contain a valid URL or valid domain name are ignored, so you can have comments and annotation in the file if you so wish.

### --method

The default HTTP method is `GET` but you can modify this

```text
ccc example.com --method head
```

### --headers *collection*

By default the listed response headers are limited to `x-cache`, `cache-control`, `server`, `content-encoding`, `vary`, `age`; but this is just the **default** headers collection. You can use the `--headers` switch to specify and alternate collection of headers, and can use ``list-header-collections` to view all collections as described [here].(#list-header-collections).

For example, there's a collection that lists **security** related response headers:

```text
ccc https://www.mozilla.org/ --headers security
```

![cdn-cache-check - Example of header collection 'security'](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ccc.example.header.security.gif)

### --list-header-collections

Use `--list-header-collection` to see all of the configured **Header Collections** and which responses are included in each. The location of the configuration file is also shown, which you can edit to include your own custom **Header Collection**.

```text
ccc --list-header-collections
```

![cdn-cache-check - Example listing all header collections](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ccc.example.list-header-collections.gif)

### --list-response-headers

`--list-response-headers` is used to display the names of each unique response header returned from the URL(s) provided. It's primary purpose is to assist with creating a custom [header collection](#--list-header-collection) as it shows all the headers from which a custom list can be selected.

```text
ccc https://www.amazon.com https://www.amazon.co.uk --list-response-headers
```

![cdn-cache-check - Example listing response headers](https://marksmurphy.github.io/img/ccc.example.list-response-headers.gif)

### --export

`--export` accepts a boolean value and allows you control whether the results are also written to a `.csv` file. The default is `true`; to switch it off use:

```text
ccc https://example.com --export false
```

### --open

If the results are exported to a `.csv` file then `--open` will automatically open the file in whatever the registered application for `.csv` files is.

### --no-color

Switches off colour output.  Useful if piping output somewhere which doesn't handle the unicode control codes.

### --version

Displays the version number.

### --help

Displays the help screen.

## Features

### CDN Detection

The CDN detection works by perform a recursive DNS lookup on the target domain and looking through the `CNAME` records for an entry in an apex domain that's known to be owned by a CDN service. If the target domain resolves to an `A` record there is no information with which to make a determination, so those domains will be listed as `Undetermined`.

The detection technique also works for cloud hosting services, so services like AWS's S3, Azure's Blob Storage and GitHub Pages will also be identified.

### .csv Export

All results will be written in full to a `csv` file in the `temp` directory. The full path of this file is displayed in the terminal.

### Handling redirects

If the target URL results in a redirect it will be followed, and the final URL will be the one shown in the results. All output entries which are the result of following a redirect are marked with a redirect indicator `®` (and a redirect count in the `csv` export file).

```text
ccc http://thefacebook.com
```

### Error handling/reporting

Network, DNS and HTTP errors are reported in the `STATUS` column.
Example:

```text
ccc https://www.wallmart.com http://aksjdfkasdnfkja.com
```

## Debugging

Include the `--debug` switch to get verbose debug output.

```text
ccc www.bing.com --debug
```
