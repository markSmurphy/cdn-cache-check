# To Do

* ~~Expand `settings` to incorporate `needle`'s options json~~
* Filter response headers based on selected header collection
* ~~Format output into columns~~
* Implement `--header-collections`
* Implement `--headers`
* Allow request headers to be injected
* Collect all unique response headers and optionally list them out `--list-response-headers`
* Attempt CDN detection based on `CNAME` apex domain.
* Add date/time into request details and output columns
* ~~Colour output to indicate cache hit & cache miss~~
  * Friendly interpretation based on CDN's x-cache documentation
* Implement iterations (with `interval` observed between)
* ~~Expand `user-agent` {variables} when reading config~~
* Command line arguments for:
  * `timeout`
  * `response_timeout`
  * `read_timeout`
  * `follow`
* Export to CSV
  * [jsonexport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonexport)
  * Perhaps export all response headers to separate `csv` file when `debug` is enabled
* Implement full debug request/response logging
* Implement progress bar when issuing many requests and/or many iterations| [npmlog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npmlog)
* Implement `settings.options` passed through to `needle`
  * Allow `options` override from command line
* ~~Investigate the spurious `400` responses~~
* ~~Allow customisation of user-agent string (avoid bot detection)~~
* ~~Investigate why req.path has `needle` options `json` concatenated~~
* Investigate merits of implementing a custom [http_agent](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)
